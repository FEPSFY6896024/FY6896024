 <h2><b>Abstract</b></h2>
  <p>
   This page explores the role of generative AI in music creation focusing on key components such as Lyric Generation, vocal synthesis and audio/wave synthesis. We explore how chat GPT works to generate lyrical content and how technologies like Tacotron 2 and WaveNet are used to generate vocals and audio through waveform synthesis. We will also explore the legality of using this technology for commercial music purposes and whether this violates copyright laws or the right of publicity.

  <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
  <p class="ex1">
    Since the release of Chat GPT by open AI in 2022, artificial intelligence has been the hottest topic when it comes to technology, and has been rapidly implemented into several different industries, an example of which - the music industry. From generating fully recorded, mixed and mastered songs of any genre, to replicating the vocals of reputable artists, let's break down exactly how generative AI is used to create music, and explore the potential uses and legal concerns of this technology.

The current and most popular AI music generators on the market are Soundraw, Soundful, Suno.ai and Mubert . Like in Figure 1, these AI’s generate music from a text input from the user, where the user describes the genre, lyrical theme and tempo of the song they desire.  Generating a song requires 3 main components, Lyrical Generation, Vocal Generation and generating the soundtrack itself, which Suno manages to do all in one go. But let’s look at each process in detail.

   “Active  Learning (Angluin,  1988,  Cohn  et  al.,  1994)  is  a  paradigm  where  a  concept  is  learnt  by  an intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential to  improve  the  classification  model.  Various  strategies  have  been  proposed  including;  Query  by Committee  (Seung  et  al.,  1992),Monte  Carlo  estimation  (Roy  and  McCallum,  2001),  uncertainty sampling  (Lewis  and  Gale,  1994)  and  version  space  reduction  (margin  sampling)  (Tong  and  Koller, 2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are presented  for  labeling,  to  a  machine  (database)  or  human  oracle  that  has  knowledge  of  the  class labels.  After  adding  the  newly  labeled  instances  to  the  current  training  set,  a  revised  model  is subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve anefficient, incremental advancement of learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008) "

    <h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
    <p>
     We’re still a long way away from fully replacing singers and musicians. A lot of these models create music that sounds generated, and lacking human feel, but as the internet grows, AI models will acquire more data to train on and become better.
