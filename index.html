    Investment banking is a part of the financial world that helps companies and governments raise money and make important financial decisions. For example, if a company wants to expand by building new stores or launching a new product, they may need a lot of money. Investment bankers help them raise this money by selling shares of the company (stock) or issuing bonds, which is a way of borrowing money. They also assist when companies want to merge with or buy other companies, which is called mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Investment bankers provide advice on how much a company is worth, help negotiate the deal, and take care of all the legal and financial details. Another key part of investment banking is advising clients on managing risks and structuring their finances. For instance, if a company is worried about losing money due to changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates, investment bankers can help them develop strategies to protect against those risks. Though it can be a fast-paced and demanding job, with long hours, it offers the opportunity to work on big deals and potentially earn a high salary. Many people start as analysts, learning the ins and outs of the business before moving up to more senior roles.
