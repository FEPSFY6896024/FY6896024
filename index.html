 <h1><b>Abstract</b></h1>
  <p>
   This page explores the role of generative AI in music creation focusing on key components such as Lyric Generation, vocal synthesis and audio/wave synthesis. We explore how chat GPT works to generate lyrical content and how technologies like Tacotron 2 and WaveNet are used to generate vocals and audio through waveform synthesis. We will also explore the legality of using this technology for commercial music purposes and whether this violates copyright laws or the right of publicity.

  <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
  <p class="ex1">
    Since the release of Chat GPT by open AI in 2022, artificial intelligence has been the hottest topic when it comes to technology, and has been rapidly implemented into several different industries, an example of which - the music industry. From generating fully recorded, mixed and mastered songs of any genre, to replicating the vocals of reputable artists, let's break down exactly how generative AI is used to create music, and explore the potential uses and legal concerns of this technology.

The current and most popular AI music generators on the market are Soundraw, Soundful, Suno.ai and Mubert . Like in Figure 1, these AI’s generate music from a text input from the user, where the user describes the genre, lyrical theme and tempo of the song they desire.  Generating a song requires 3 main components, Lyrical Generation, Vocal Generation and generating the soundtrack itself, which Suno manages to do all in one go. But let’s look at each process in detail.

  <p class="ex1">
   “Active  Learning (Angluin,  1988,  Cohn  et  al.,  1994)  is  a  paradigm  where  a  concept  is  learnt  by  an intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential to  improve  the  classification  model.  Various  strategies  have  been  proposed  including;  Query  by Committee  (Seung  et  al.,  1992),Monte  Carlo  estimation  (Roy  and  McCallum,  2001),  uncertainty sampling  (Lewis  and  Gale,  1994)  and  version  space  reduction  (margin  sampling)  (Tong  and  Koller, 2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are presented  for  labeling,  to  a  machine  (database)  or  human  oracle  that  has  knowledge  of  the  class labels.  After  adding  the  newly  labeled  instances  to  the  current  training  set,  a  revised  model  is subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve anefficient, incremental advancement of learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008) "

    <h3> How Artificial Intelligence is used to generate music from scratch </h3>
    <br>
    <p> Ever since the release of Chat GPT by open AI in 2022, artificial intelligence has been the hottest topic when it comes to technology, and has been rapidly implemented into several different industries, an example of which - the music industry. From generating fully recorded, mixed and mastered songs of any genre, to replicating the vocals of reputable artists, there’s still a lot of room for improvement. But let’s break down exactly how generative AI is used to create music, and explore the potential uses and legal concerns of this technology.
</p>
    <br>
    → How are these AI’s trained on all this music?
→ Where do these AI algorithms get their data ? 
So far, AI algorithms are trained on data collected from Publically available Datasets, online repositories and user-contributed data - https://www.icom.ai/blog-posts/where-does-ai-get-its-data#:~:text=Image%20AI%20can%20gather%20data,train%20the%20AI%20models%20effectively. 
An example of such datasets is the ‘MusicCaps’, a dataset containing 5,521 music examples, each of which is labeled with an English aspect list and a free text caption written by musicians.
→ Who created, collected and published these datasets and why ?

→  the legality behind open source AI etc.

Reference heart on my sleeve AI banger
Talk about legality of AI technology, stealing and using artist’s voices behind their backs.
Mention how AI prompts/generation will take up ⅓ of the world’s power by 2030.
“user’s listening habits mapping by Digital Service Providers (DSP)” - research what they are https://www.bmat.com/what-really-is-ai-music/ 

“AI systems also utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and generate human language, computer vision to interpret visual information from images or videos, and reinforcement learning to make sequential decisions through trial and error.” - https://www.bmat.com/what-really-is-ai-music/ 

“Markov chains were used to predict the most likely musical note, depending on the previous musical notes in the Markov chain. While Markovian models are good options for real time applications since they are relatively less complex, these models fail to produce novel music and can only produce musical sequences which are already existent in the original data.” - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8628712&utm_source=sciencedirect_contenthosting&getft_integrator=sciencedirect_contenthosting&tag=1 

“ Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Long short term memory (LSTMs) networks are being used because of their capability to keep track of the musical notes generated in the past, and accordingly predict new musical notes.” - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8628712&utm_source=sciencedirect_contenthosting&getft_integrator=sciencedirect_contenthosting&tag=1 

“ The ABC notation [2] is an accepted standard developed by Walshaw, which represents music using a specified syntax written in plain text format.” 

An example of a musical tune in its ABC format is shown in fig. 2. - 
The Key:
‘ | ’ = represents the division between notes for each measure of the sheet music (ABC Dataset).



Every musical tune in the ABC format comprises of two parts: the header and the musical notes. The first 7 lines in fig 2 represent the header part, which gives the information about the tune reference number (X), title (T), comments (%), composer (S), meter (M), base chord (K) and note length (L). It represents all the background information other than the harmonic tunes which is related to the music. The M field denotes the meter of the song, which refers to the regularly recurring patterns and accents such as bars and beats. The value left to “/” represents number of beats per measure. The K field denotes the base chord, and can take a value from A to G. The L field in header describes the note length. 1/4 means that each letter in the note section is of a quarter-note length. The musical notes section of the ABC notation contains the information of the notes of the tune. Letters A to G represent each chord. Uppercase letters represent the higher octave ‘d’ note.

How generative AI for music works : 
→ An ABC Dataset is obtained 
→ The ABC Data is then cleaned and processed  (in order to : ) by the following steps : 
Headers and comments from the text are removed since only the musical notes are important for the generation of music.
Remove the ‘ | ’ symbol - which represents the division between notes for each measure of the sheet music (ABC Dataset). Since this piece if information isn’t related to musical notes, it is removed.
Various special characters such as the [ ] which represents a chord, pauses and () or {} which represent tuplets, slurs and ornaments are removed because they do not  
Anything that is expressed as x<y or x>y where x and y are valid notes, is now represented as x3/2y/2 and x/2y3/2, so they’re replaced.
The ABC Dataset uses a^ to represent flat notes, and the symbols is swapped for a# for 

The dataset is then trained by a LSTM model - a Long Short-term Memory, which is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that is designed to retain information for a long time

The instrument choice, tempo, meter and key are provided by the user through a graphical user interface.
However the ABC Notation has to be converted to its musical form in order to generate actual music. The obtained ABC notation is converted to MIDI format using an ABC to midi converter, an example of which being the https://melobytes.com/en/app/abc2midi .

What has to be taken into consideration for AI music to be created: 
→ lyrical contents
→ Rhyme of each line of lyrics
→ How many words per lyrical line
→ rhythmic elements
→ Scale 
→ Instruments/tonality 
→ Bass/drums

AI Models run off of Artificial Neuron Networks, which are like computer systems that replicate the neural pathways of the brain.
