 <h1><b>Abstract</b></h1>
  <p>
    Investment banking is a part of the financial world that helps companies and governments raise money and make important financial decisions. For example, if a company wants to expand by building new stores or launching a new product, they may need a lot of money. Investment bankers help them raise this money by selling shares of the company (stock) or issuing bonds, which is a way of borrowing money. They also assist when companies want to merge with or buy other companies, which is called mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Investment bankers provide advice on how much a company is worth, help negotiate the deal, and take care of all the legal and financial details. Another key part of investment banking is advising clients on managing risks and structuring their finances. For instance, if a company is worried about losing money due to changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates, investment bankers can help them develop strategies to protect against those risks. Though it can be a fast-paced and demanding job, with long hours, it offers the opportunity to work on big deals and potentially earn a high salary. Many people start as analysts, learning the ins and outs of the business before moving up to more senior roles.

  <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
  <p class="ex1">
    In addition to raising money and helping with mergers and acquisitions, investment bankers also play a key role in initial public offerings (IPOs). This happens when a company decides to go public and sell shares to the general public for the first time. Investment bankers help the company determine the right price for its shares, market the IPO to potential investors, and ensure everything goes smoothly on the day of the launch.
    <br>
    It’s a big step for any company, and investment bankers are there to guide the process. Investment bankers also help companies restructure their finances when they’re in trouble. If a company is struggling with debt or other financial issues, bankers can advise on how to reorganize the company’s operations or debt to improve its financial health.
    <br> This could involve negotiating with creditors or finding new investors. Though the work can be intense and stressful, with tight deadlines and high stakes, investment banking is a field that attracts people who enjoy problem-solving, working with numbers, and playing a key role in important financial decisions. It offers a fast-paced, rewarding environment for those looking to make an impact in the business world.

   “Active  Learning (Angluin,  1988,  Cohn  et  al.,  1994)  is  a  paradigm  where  a  concept  is  learnt  by  an intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential to  improve  the  classification  model.  Various  strategies  have  been  proposed  including;  Query  by Committee  (Seung  et  al.,  1992),Monte  Carlo  estimation  (Roy  and  McCallum,  2001),  uncertainty sampling  (Lewis  and  Gale,  1994)  and  version  space  reduction  (margin  sampling)  (Tong  and  Koller, 2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are presented  for  labeling,  to  a  machine  (database)  or  human  oracle  that  has  knowledge  of  the  class labels.  After  adding  the  newly  labeled  instances  to  the  current  training  set,  a  revised  model  is subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve anefficient, incremental advancement of learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008) "
